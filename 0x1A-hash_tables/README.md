# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

## Behind the Simplicity of Python Dictionaries

	Python dictionaries are built using hash tables, a powerful data structure that allows for fast lookups. This means that even though creating a dictionary seems simple, like d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}, there's a lot going on behind the scenes to make it efficient.

	While Python's internal implementation might differ slightly, if you're interested in how dictionaries work under the hood, here's a helpful blog post specifically about Python 2.7 dictionary implementation: [link to blog post about Python 2.7 dictionary implementation].
	
## Learning Objectives
	At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
	What is a hash function
	What makes a good hash function
	What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
	What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
	What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
	What are the most common use cases of hash tables
