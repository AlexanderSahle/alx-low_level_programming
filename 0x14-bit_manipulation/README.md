#  C - Bit manipulation

## Learning Objectives

	At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

	Look for the right source of information without too much help
	How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## TASKS

* 0. 0
	- [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c): C function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.


* 1. 1
	- [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c): C function that prints the binary representation of a number.

* 2. 10
	- [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c): C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

* 3. 11
	- [3-set_bit.c](./3-set_bit.c): C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to `1`.

* 4. 100
	- [4-clear_bit.c](./4-clear_bit.c): C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to `0`.

* 5. 101
	- [5-flip_bits.c](./5-flip_bits.c): C function that returns the number of bits needed

* 6. Endianness
	- [100-get_endianness.c](./100-get_endianness.c): C function that checks the endianness.

* 7. Crackme3
	- [101-password](./101-password): File containing the password for the crackme3
