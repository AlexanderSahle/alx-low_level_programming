# C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Learning Objectives
	At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
	What are pointers and how to use them
	What are arrays and how to use them
	What are the differences between pointers and arrays
	How to use strings and how to manipulate them
	Scope of variables

# Tasks

0. strcat

	Write a function that concatenates two strings.
	Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);

1. strncat

	Write a function that concatenates two strings.
	Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);

2. strncpy
	
	Write a function that copies a string.
	Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);

3. strcmp
	Write a function that compares two strings.
	Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);

4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy
	
	Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
	Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);
	Where n is the number of elements of the array

5. Always look up

	Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
	Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);

6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes

	Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.
	Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);
	Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }


7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody

	Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.

8. rot13

	Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.
	Prototype: char *rot13(char *);

9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

	Write a function that prints an integer.

10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work

	Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.

11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art

	Write a function that adds two numbers.

	Prototype: char *infinite_add(char *n1, char *n2, char *r, int size_r);
